Next.js 14 is out, and it brings a host of new features and performance improvements. But why stop there? By combining Next.js 14 with Shadcn/UI, TypeScript, Million.js, and ESLint, you can supercharge your development experience even further. In this guide, we'll walk you through setting up these powerful tools using Bun, a fast and modern JavaScript runtime.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Next.js 14 Project with Bun

First things first, let's create a new Next.js 14 project using Bun.

```bash
bun x create-next-app@latest

cd my-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js 14 project with all the dependencies you need.

## Step 2: Integrating Shadcn/UI for Elegant Components

Shadcn/UI is a powerful and versatile component library that pairs perfectly with Next.js and TypeScript. To add Shadcn/UI to your project, start by running:

```bash
bun x shadcn@latest init
```

This command will initialize Shadcn/UI in your project. Youâ€™ll be prompted to configure `components.json`:

- **Style**: Choose your preferred style (e.g., New York).
- **Base Color**: Select a base color (e.g., Zinc).
- **CSS Variables**: Decide whether to use CSS variables for colors.

Once configured, you can start adding components to your project. For example, to add a Button component, run:

```bash
bun x shadcn@latest add button
```

Then, import and use the component like so:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Shadcn/UI's components are fully typed, ensuring a seamless development experience with TypeScript.

## Step 3: Setting Up Million Lint for Code Optimization

Million Lint is a VSCode extension that helps you optimize your React code by highlighting and fixing performance issues. To get started, install Million Lint via the CLI:

```bash
bun x million@latest
```

During the installation, you'll be prompted to install the Million Lint build plugin and the VSCode extension. Once set up, you'll receive suggestions to optimize your code automatically.

## Conclusion

By combining Next.js 14 with Shadcn/UI, TypeScript, Million.js, Million Lint, and ESLint, you've created a powerhouse development environment that's both fast and efficient. Using Bun as your runtime and package manager ensures that your setup is lightning-quick and hassle-free. Happy coding!
